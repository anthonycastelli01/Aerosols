# Aerosols

These work best as an iPython notebook at the moment, as they don't output any of the plots as files.

<ul>
    <li><h5>Box Plot</h5> generates the plot of the binned data based on a time slider.</li>
    <li><h5>Particle Sources</h5> takes a random aerosol particle in the selected bin and generates a plot of its composition.</li>
    <li><h5>Combined Plotting</h5> combines Box Plot and Particle Sources into one page. Soon, the Box Plot will have interactive functions implemented to make finding populated bins easier.</li>
</ul>
