# Aerosols

These work best as iPython notebooks at the moment, as they don't output any of the plots as files.

<ul>
    <li><b>Box Plot</b> generates the plot of the binned data based on a time slider.</li>
    <li><b>Particle Sources</b> takes a random aerosol particle in the selected bin and generates a plot of its composition.</li>
    <li><b>Combined Plotting</b> combines Box Plot and Particle Sources into one page. Soon, the Box Plot will have interactive functions implemented to make finding populated bins easier.</li>
</ul>
